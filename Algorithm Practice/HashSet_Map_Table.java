/*
Difference among 
HashSet HashMap HashTable

HashSet only store the object: add() hasCode() equals()
	can not store duplicate object
HashMap store <key, object> : put() get() containsKey() 
	can store duplicate value iff key is different
HashTable almost same with HashMap, but is syncronized and not accept null value.
